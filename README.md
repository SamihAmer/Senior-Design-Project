# Senior Design NEquest Virtual Neurological Assistant 
Progress: April 29th 2022 <br/>
Horizontal tracking implementation via edge points of the eye is now implemented <br/>
Data normalization and moving average measures also implemented to reduce noise <br/>
Graphs and Data outputs now reflect time series data <br/>
We are also in the midst of developing our ML algortihm and training data sets to classify movement with greater accuracy.  <br/>

Progress: February 15th 2022 <br/>
This is the github repository for the code of team CSANS for our senior design project.  <br/>
Current implementation uses the Mediapipe Facemesh and Iris Detection system to classify movement. <br/>
We are also in the midst of developing our ML algortihm and training data sets to classify movement with greater accuracy.  <br/>
